# Machine_Learning_Project
The project uses the Medical Personal Cost Dataset from Kaggle to predict insurance premiums.
We perform data preprocessing i.e. checking for NULL values, encoding for categorical data, etc.
EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis) through scatter, pair, box and other plots.
Box plots helps to check for the outliers.
Dist Plots helps to check skewness in data.
Then Cleaning data(removing the Outliers).
Checking for Correlation among all the independent variables.
Splitting the data into Train and Test data sets.
Scaling the data for better results.
Training(fitting) SVR(Support Vector Regression) model.
Taking the efficiency test and using most efficient model parameters.
Using REST APIs to get the predicted cost once requested through API calls(requests).
